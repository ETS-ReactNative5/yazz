Visual Javascript is a tool for building internal business applications. It has a drag and drop UI builder and uses Javascript as a scripting language. In some ways Visual Javascript can be thought of as a very lightweight version of Visual Basic. A few points of compariston to Visual Basic are:

- Visual Basic runs only on Windows whereas Visual Javascript is multi-platform
- Visual Basic is a proprietary product whereas Visual Javascript is open source
- Visual Basic uses basic as a scripting language whereas Visual Javascript uses Javascript
- Visual Javascript lacks the module system of Visual Basic
- Visual Basic applications compile to a .exe whereas Visual Javascript apps are distributed as a HTML file or as the Visual JavaScript he run time plus a .vjs file
