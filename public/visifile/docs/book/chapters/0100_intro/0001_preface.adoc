The company behind Visual Javascript is Yazz. They first coined the phrase of "Self Service Apps Without the IT Department" in 2019, and they always talk about the coming "No IT" revolution. This "No IT" revolution envisions a world where IT and technology becomes invisible, and its use will not require companies to have huge IT departments. But what does this mean? Well, take as an example your phone. It contains a lot of technology but we don't call it an IT system even though internally it is just like a PC from the 1990's. Instead we just call it a phone (even then word "smart" has been dropped from smart phone these days). At Yazz we believe that the same thing will happen to the technology that powers your business. It will eventually fade into the background and become invisible, meaning that the people in your company will be creating new automated systems all the time, it is just that they won't be calling them IT systems anymore, and they won't need IT departments to build these systems.

The history of Visual Javascript is a long and varied one. The founder first thought about building a web based development tool since he was at University where he built a Hypercard style development tool called OpenPage (using C++ on Solaris) as his final year Computer Science project at Manchester University. The second version was written in Java, but this didn't go anywhere. The third version was developed in Javascript, Ruby and Sinatra in 2007, but was too simplistic. Also, in 2008 a fourth attempt was made in Erlang. A fifth attempt was built a Clojure/Clojurescript based tool called Clojure on Coils, which the author thought was pretty cool since it has front end SQL and a time travelling debugger, but most people in the community thought that it was a joke. Eventually after a couple of years the founder outsourced the problem by investing in a project by Chris Granger and Rob Attori, called LightTable/Eve. They tried to solve the problem of building a usable development system until 2018.

After 2018 the founder took a step back and realised that he had a lot of knowledge about the subject, but needed to find a way to build something that can be commercially viable, as this is a problem that 10,000s of companies have tackled unsuccessfully (just pick up a 1980s edition of Personal Computer to see many companies attempting the same thing). So for a seventh attempt, the author tried to create a tool for enterprise users to build small webapps which can integrate with other systems, based on the look and feel of Visual Basic 6. The product is called Visual Javascript, and has a simple VB style editor, and allows you to build GUI apps, and micro-services. It uses a simple component model based on a single Javascript function per component, for both server side and front end components. It uses NodeJS, SQLite, and VueJS. It can also run as an Electron desktop app. It can run on Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift.
