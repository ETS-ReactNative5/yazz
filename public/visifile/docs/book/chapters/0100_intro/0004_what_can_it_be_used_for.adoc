Visual Javascript is meant to be used for quick and simple applications:

- Small internal business apps
- Dashboards for monitoring systems
- Data imports from MS Access or Excel
- Visualisations of complex environments
- Small microservices

Visual Javascript would be terrible for:

- Writing an operating system
- Writing low level device drivers
