Visual Javascript can be used for many applications:

- Small internal business apps
- Dashboards for monitoring systems
- Data imports from MS Access or Excel
- Visualisations of complex environments
- Small microservices

However, Visual Javascript would be terrible for:

- Writing an operating system
- Writing low level device drivers
